        <h2>Life Currently</h2><br>
        <p>I'm currently the Data Analyst at Amazon, and just made 1.5 years in my role. I love what I do but I've started to feel stagnant and I am ready to grow. Amazon supports their associates in growing and pay for schooling all the way up to a Bachelor's Degree. So, I took advantage of this opportunity and recently just finished a 5-month Software Developer Bootcamp. I've decided to continue pursuing my dream and will be enrolling into college next Spring or Summer to obtain my Master's Degree.</p>

        <h2>Black Women in Technology</h2><br>
        <p>Before everyone even knew of the movie, Hidden Figures, I was already following and ready to break into the STEM workd solely because of learning about Katherin Johnson. In my high school math class, I was assigned a project and chose her because of her historic findings and doings in the STEM world. I was even more intrigued when I found out about her personal history and her life story inspired me so much. I started doing research on STEM degrees and programs and her sororitys' history as well, whcih I did eventually join in college.</p>

        <h2>What sparked my interest in computers?</h2><br>
        <p>In elementary school, I was always into sports, dancing, and singing. I was a honors student and have always loved learning, so school was naturally fun for me. One day, in my computer class I started clicking around and became very interestsed in what there was to explore and learn about them. I took up a typing class and joined both FBLA and DECA where my knowledge grew with business and computers. I stopped attending recess and would spend my extra time learning about technology and all the ins and outs with it.</p>
